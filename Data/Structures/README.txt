Use for solar integrated reflection versus wavelength use, (note this is integrated from 280 nm to 1200 nm);
Each file contains the 'data' variable with the top row theta(degrees) and the bottom row the integrated reflection

Use for solar integrated reflection versus wavelength use, (note this is integrated from 280 nm to 1200 nm);
Each mat file contains three variables;  thetaVec, lambdaVec, and reflectionMat
thetaVec is a column vector with all the angles in degrees
lambaVec is a row vector with all the wavelengths in nm
reflectionMat is a matrix with dimensions nThetaVec by nLambdaVec with the reflection as a function of angle and wavelength
